Coding the Humanities is not about technology or even programming. It is all about tools. Software is a blind spot for the humanities. While our discipline is deeply committed to self-reflection, we hardly ever think about the digital tools that we are using on a daily basis. As a result, we fail to make an obvious observation. The applications that facilitate our teaching and research, were not written for us, let alone developed by us. In fact, they are unfit to fit our needs.

In our research, we use a wordprocessor for almost everything. This factotum is part of a larger suite of proprietary enterprise applications, and is appropriately named after its intended use context. In an office setting this swiss army knife may be highly effective, but for research purposes, however, it is blunt. This pimped out typewriter does not offer any form of semantic mark up, has no citation management, and discourages collaboration. 

In teaching, the situation is possibly even more dire. While the omnipresent word processor is a mismatch with our research practice, most online teaching platfforms go to the other extreme: they are indistinguishable from it. Their user interfaces exactly mimics the classroom setting. Its conceptual metaphors are sessions, discussions, assignments, etc. This also means, however, that they make little to no effort to actually enhance our practice. Digital tools have the potential to radically change the way scholars teach and students learn. Unfortunately, this promise remains unfulfilled.

Even worse than our inadequate research and teaching tools individually, however, may be the fact that they are completely unrelated. Of course, it is possible to embed text documents in our teaching platforms, but that is about as far as the integration goes. We complain about the ever increasing disconnect between our teaching and research, but do not realize that our tools do nothing to help us bridge that gap. 

Still, no matter how bad our tools are, we do not talk about them. Humanities' scholar have more important things to discuss. We are interested in content, not in the structures that create it. We thereby selectively ignore most twentieth century theory which should have taught us to focus on the system that produce knowledge rather than on the results of that system. 

How different is the situation in software development. ... 


A deliberate use of tools marks the difference between craftmanship and labor.   

By solving all problems with his hammer, the dumb worker reduces all problem to nails. Appropriate tools do not only increase the craftman's efficiency, they also enhance the craftmans ability to differentiate between different problems.
