*Coding the Humanities* is not about technology or even programming. It is all about tools. Software is a blind spot for the humanities. While our discipline is deeply committed to self-reflection, we hardly ever think about the digital tools that we are using on a daily basis. The applications that facilitate our teaching and research, were not written for us, let alone developed by us.

In our reseach, we use a wordprocessor for almost everything. This factotum is part of a larger suite of proprietary enterprise applications, that is appropriately named after its intended use context. In an office setting this swiss army knife may be highly effective, but for our purposes, however, it is blunt. This pimped out typewriter does not offer any form of semantic mark up, has no citation management, and discourages collaboration. 

In teaching, the situation is probably even more dire. 

Still, even worse than the omnipresence of such inadequate tools, is the fact that there is hardly any discussions surrounding them. We talk about content, not about the structures that create it. We complain about the disconnect between our teaching and research, but do not realize that our tools do not facilitate such connections.

How different is the situation in software development. 


A deliberate use of tools marks the difference between craftmanship and labor.   

By solving all problems with his hammer, the dumb worker reduces all problem to nails. Appropriate tools do not only increase the craftman's efficiency, they also enhance the craftmans ability to differentiate between different problems.
