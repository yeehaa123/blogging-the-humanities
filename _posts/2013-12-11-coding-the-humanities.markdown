'Coding the Humanities' is not about technology or even programming. It is all about tools. Software is a blind spot for the humanities. While our discipline is deeply committed to self-reflection, we hardly ever think about the digital tools that we are using on a daily basis. As a result, we fail to make an obvious observation. The applications that facilitate our teaching and research, were not written for us, let alone developed by us. In fact, they are unfit to fit our needs.

In our research, we use a wordprocessor for almost everything. This factotum is part of a larger suite of proprietary enterprise applications, that is appropriately named after its intended use context. In an office setting this swiss army knife may be highly effective, but for our purposes, however, it is blunt. This pimped out typewriter does not offer any form of semantic mark up, has no citation management, and discourages collaboration. 

In teaching, the situation is possibly even more dire. While the omnipresent word processor is a mismatch with our research practice, online teaching platfforms go to the other extreme: they are indistinguishable from it. Their user interfaces exactly mimic the classroom. There are sessions, discussions, assignments, etc. This also means, however, that they do little to nothing to actually change our practice. Digital tools have the potential to radically improve the students' experience. Unfortunately, this promise remains unfulfilled.

More importantly that our research and teaching tools individually, howerver, is the fact that they are completely unrelated. Of course, it is possible to embed text documents in our teaching platforms, but that's about as far as the integration goes. We complain about the disconnect between our teaching and research, but do not realize that the software that we use does not facilitate such connections.

Even worse than the omnipresence of inadequate tools, is the fact that there is hardly any discussions about them. Humanities talk about content, not about the structures that create it. How different is the situation in software development. 


A deliberate use of tools marks the difference between craftmanship and labor.   

By solving all problems with his hammer, the dumb worker reduces all problem to nails. Appropriate tools do not only increase the craftman's efficiency, they also enhance the craftmans ability to differentiate between different problems.
